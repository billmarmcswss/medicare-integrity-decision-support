\## Decision Owner Role Reference



Each decision module is assigned to a named operational role within the

CMS/UPIC/OIG program integrity structure. Decision Owner roles differ across

modules because each decision belongs to a distinct operational function.

No analytical output in this framework constitutes a decision — outputs

inform named Decision Owners who retain full operational authority.

| D-PI-1 | Provider Review Entry | Investigations Lead / Program Integrity Analytics Manager | PI |

| D-PI-2 | Escalation Threshold | Investigations Lead / UPIC Case Development Manager | PI |

| D-POL-1 | Code Scrutiny | Medical Review Director / MAC Medical Director | POL |

| D-POL-2 | Specialty Pattern Shift | Medical Review Director / CPI Policy Analyst | POL |

| D-OPS-1 | Monitoring Placement | UPIC Operations Manager / CPI Monitoring Unit Lead | OPS |
