## Decision

Which providers in the D-PI-1 review queue meet the threshold for escalation
to formal referral — to OIG, RAC, or equivalent enforcement structures —
based on signal persistence, dollar exposure, and pattern severity?

## Status Note

This module is currently in active development as part of the
Medicare Integrity Decision Support framework. It builds directly
on outputs produced by D-PI-1 Provider Review Entry.

All analytical outputs will describe statistical patterns only.
No outputs will constitute findings of fraud, waste, or abuse.

See repository root `README.md` for full project architecture and roadmap.
