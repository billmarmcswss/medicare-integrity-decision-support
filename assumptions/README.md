# Assumptions

**Status:** In Development

---

## Purpose

This folder documents declared analytical assumptions made across all modules
of the Medicare Integrity Decision Support framework.

Assumptions are gap-filling declarations made where data is unavailable,
incomplete, or insufficient to support a direct observation or derivation.
All assumptions are tagged with the evidence marker `A` in module outputs
and carry explicit rationale for their use.

## Assumption Register

Assumption entries will be added here as modules are completed. Each entry
will reference the module that declared it, the gap it addresses, and the
analytical impact of the assumption on outputs.

---

## Governance Footnote

This folder is part of the Medicare Integrity Decision Support framework
established February 2026. All analytical outputs describe statistical
patterns only. No outputs constitute findings of fraud, waste, or abuse.

See repository root `README.md` for full project architecture and roadmap.
